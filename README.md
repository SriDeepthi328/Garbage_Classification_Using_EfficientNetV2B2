# Garbage_Classification_Using_EfficientNetV2B2
**"A cleaner future starts with intelligent classification."**
It is a deep learning-based image classification project that automatically identifies garbage types (plastic, metal, cardboard, etc.) using EfficientNetV2B2 â€” a state-of-the-art transfer learning model. This solution enables intelligent waste segregation and supports eco-friendly smart city applications.


**Features:**

    1.Advanced CNN: EfficientNetV2B2 for superior performance and faster training.
    
    2.Real-Time Custom Image Prediction: Upload your own images and get accurate predictions.
    
    3.Training Visualizations: Clear plots of accuracy/loss during training.
    
    4.Evaluation Metrics: Precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.
    
    5.Web Interface (Gradio): Easy-to-use UI for testing the model in real-time.
